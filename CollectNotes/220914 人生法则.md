看完了乔丹彼得森的《人生十二法则》演讲，有很多被鼓舞到的细节地方。

记下核心的12条法则：

-   do not carelessly denigrate social institutions or creative achievement
-   imagine who you could be, and then aim single-mindedly at that
-   do not hide unwanted things in the fog
-   notice that opportunity lurks where responsibility has been abdicated
-   do not do what you hate
-   abandon ideology
-   work as hard as you possibly can on at least one thing and see what happens
-   try to make one room in your home as beautiful as possible
-   if old memories still upset you,write them down carefully and completely
-   plan and work diligently to maintain the romance in your relationship
-   do not allow yourself to become resentful, deceitful, or arrogant
-   be grateful in spite of your suffering

在最结尾所回答的那个问题，在我们把世界变得更好之前，12条法则都依然是做得不够好的。

那一段话，值得单独摘下来。

关于"世界有问题"与"我有问题"，需要改变的是我——那一段也非常地令人动容。
